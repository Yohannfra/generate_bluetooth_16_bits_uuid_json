# generate_bluetooth_16_bits_uuid_json

A little script to generate a json file from the content of [this pdf](https://btprodspecificationrefs.blob.core.windows.net/assigned-values/16-bit%20UUID%20Numbers%20Document.pdf) that describes all ble 16-bits identifiers.

I made this script to easily generate a dictionary to get identifier name from 16 bit raw bytes (for [this program](https://github.com/Yohannfra/ble_repl))
